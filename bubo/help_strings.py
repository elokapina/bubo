For example:

    breakout How awesome is Bubo?

it in any way like the rooms created using the `rooms` command.

`power <user> <room> [<level>]`

* `user` is the user ID, example `@user:example.tld`

  The %%TYPE%% must have an alias. Usage:
  
  `link #room-alias:domain.tld`
  
* `link-and-admin`
